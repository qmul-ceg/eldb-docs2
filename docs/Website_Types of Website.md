# Types of Website

## Dynamic Website

Website elements stored and compiled together to form the webpage for the visitor

- can adapt to info from cookies, browser info, geotime, other webpages

> "Good morning and welcome back Kelvin!"

## Static Website

Like a website from 1999, each web page is a file

- simple + quick

But can utilise web developments:

- **CSS (Cascading Style Sheets)**
  
  - defines webpage elements to allow themes across html pages

- **JavaScript**
  
  - web page programs to allow interactive elements

- **Markdown**
  
  - lightweight Markup language for formatting of plain text, allows quick and easy building of web pages without needing html
